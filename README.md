### Search and Queue YouTube videos in a Unified and Distraction-Free Environment

YouTube is a fantastic learning resource, but ads and recommendations via the algorithm get in the way of productivity on the main site. When you just need to learn something, the distractions need to go.

There are a few browser extensions designed to deal with this issue, but they suffer from lack of maintenance, availability, or functionality across all targets, as they try to put a bandaid on the issue by hiding the parts you don't want to see. With this focustube, there are no recommendations or comments to hide; search for what you need, queue the videos that will get you there, watch them. Done.
